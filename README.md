# pytorch_template

A documented template for a supervised deep learning project in PyTorch. Use `datasets.py` to define custom datasets and dataloaders, `models.py` to define architectures, and fill in the hyperparameters in `pytorch-training-loop.ipynb` to run through the training loop, with timing and validation metrics computed at each epoch.
